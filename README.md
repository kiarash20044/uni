# Student Dashboard - Technical Specification Project

This repository contains the source code for a modern, animated, and responsive dashboard web application built for university students. The primary focus is on a high-quality user experience for Persian/Farsi-speaking users (RTL) while maintaining full English compatibility.

## âœ¨ Core Features

* **Pure Vanilla JS (ES6+):** No frameworks are used for core logic, demonstrating mastery of the fundamentals.
* **Custom Router:** A lightweight, powerful routing system using the History API for clean URLs and smooth, animated page transitions.
* **Modern "SaaSy" Aesthetic:** Features visually striking effects like **Glassmorphism** and **Neon/Glowing Accents**.
* **Advanced Animations:** Smooth and performant animations using **GSAP** for page transitions, element reveals, and micro-interactions.
* **Full RTL & i18n Support:** Architected from the ground up for Persian (RTL) users, with seamless English (LTR) support via a dedicated internationalization service.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** A logical separation of concerns with reusable components (`StatCard`, `Sidebar`) and page-specific views (`home.js`).
* **Local-First Data:** All user data is persisted in `localStorage` with a robust service layer.
* **Styling with Bulma & Custom CSS:** Uses the Bulma CSS framework for a solid foundation, heavily extended with custom CSS variables and effects for a unique look.
